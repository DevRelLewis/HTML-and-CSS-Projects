## HTML-and-CSS-Projects
To track and publicize the HTML and CSS course and projects

### Projects

### How they were built

I built the above projects utilizing what I learned from HTML and CSS. I have learned so far how to link files utiilizing the the link tag and with this all
being so new to me its very exciting.

### Thanks
A big shoutout to all the instructors who are so willing to help me although this README is bare minimum, if that. They show me a lot of patience and 
really live up the standard The Tech Academy has made for itself with really making sure students get the most out of the couse and ready for the
workforce.
